# shinyApp: Traumatic Injury of Brain Assistance (TIBA)
Demo Shiny app visualising a proposed framework for Traumatic Brain Injury patients as well as for caregivers. 

The framework, named Traumatic Injury of Brain Assistance (TIBA), aims to provide patients suffering from memory deficits post-TBI more autonomy in both their daily lives and rehabilitation process. It also aims to facilitate communication between a patient and their caregiver. This framework is a theoretically justified proposition, inspired by the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and other relevant literature.

The site has not been updated since spring 2020 and do produce minor errors in some domains.
