[![describtor - e.g. RStudio version](https://img.shields.io/badge/RStudio%20Version->=3.6.1-green)](www.desired_reference.com)

The framework, named Traumatic Injury of Brain Assistance (TIBA), aims to provide patients suffering from memory deficits post-TBI more autonomy in both their daily lives and rehabilitation process. It also aims to facilitate communication between a patient and their caregiver. This framework is a theoretically justified proposition, inspired by the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and other relevant literature.

The site has not been updated since spring 2020 and do produce minor errors in some domains. It is not fully developed.

**Note** <br>
The framework for TIBA is solely based on theoretical inferences from the field of HCI and TBI, meaning the actual usability and UX for any end-users remains unknown and will continue to be. It is solely a conceptual framework and only developed for an exam project as a initial suggestion for a potential design.
